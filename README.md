# Step Smart Arduino Code

This code will run on the Arduino Nano 33 IoT, and act as the brain for the walking stick prototype.

## Dependencies
Install & include these Aduino libaries:
- wifiNINA (for the on-board wifi chip)
- Arduino LSM6DS3 (for the on-board Inertial Measurement Uint, IMU)
- Arduino RTCZero (for the on-board real time clock)
- Arduino BLE (for the on-board bluetooth chip)
- Arduino JSON (for parsing json format)

## Environment variables
WiFi credentials
- "ssid" (name of the wifi network)
- "pass" (password for network)
